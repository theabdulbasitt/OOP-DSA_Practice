I don’t strictly follow the manual. I only implement functionalities that cover the core concepts so I save time, avoid unnecessary details, and focus on strengthening my fundamentals for interviews. If I get extra time, I may implement the complete version for more practice.

Tips for Someone Who Wants to Follow Too:

Keep it Minimal → Start with small implementations that clearly show the concept.

Cover Core Areas:

OOP → classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.

Data Structures → linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs.

Algorithms → sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming basics.

Databases → schema design, joins, indexes, ACID properties.

Think Interview → Always explain logic, edge cases, and complexity as if you’re in an interview.

Build a Toolbox → Treat each implementation as a pattern you can quickly recall later.

Use Extra Time Wisely → If you have time, extend your minimal code into a more complete project to deepen understanding.

Consistency Over Length → Short daily practice is more effective than long, irregular sessions.
